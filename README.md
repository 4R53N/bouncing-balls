# bouncing-balls

A simple animation using plain HTML5/CSS3/JS. 

The point of the animation is to use objects to control balls and their states.

The outcome of the dominance is pretty much pre-determined by the fact that the largest ball will eventually win. However, taken into the account that the difference in the sizes of balls is not too big, the observer is kept in thrill and 
anticipation, not knowing which color will dominate until the very end. The animation becomes even more thrilling when, unexpectedly,
the largest ball seems to almost loose to some other color but then the observer witness and celebrates the rise of the underdog. The underdog who has always been destined to dominate but some circumstances, detemined by sheer luck, made it seem like the prophecy was doomed not to happen. This, my friends, is pretty much a game of life. One can learn a lot from refreshing and observing different battles.

ENJOY!
